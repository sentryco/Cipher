 * CryptoWrapper üîë
 * - Abstract: This class provides a set of cryptographic operations using the 
 *             CryptoKit framework. It includes methods for generating 
 *             symmetric keys, encrypting and decrypting data.
 * - Description: CryptoWrapper is a class that provides a comprehensive set 
 *                of cryptographic operations. It leverages the CryptoKit 
 *                framework to generate symmetric keys, and to encrypt and 
 *                decrypt data. It is a crucial component of the SecurityLib 
 *                package, used by CryptoDB and various tests within the 
 *                securitylibtests.
 * - Note: used by CryptoDB and also some tests in securitylibtests
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è should we deprecate this, and use legacy encrypt / decrypt or? merge the two soon yes
